We describe business-critical applications and their characteristics. We present the process of continuous integration and delivery, which is an important part of developing business-critical applications. We describe the technologies that allow us to introduce best development practices and use them within the CI/CD process. 

We develop a component for establishing CI/CD with the GitLab CI/CD tool, called Medius CD. With this component, we standardize CI/CD pipelines, reduce configuration and code duplication, and simplify maintenance. The developed component is highly adaptable to various customer requirements and enables easy setup of CI/CD pipelines in both the development environment and the customer's environment.

As part of the task, we illustrate the concepts and functionalities of the component with case studies from real projects of business-critical applications that use different programming languages. This demonstrates the practical usability of the developed solution and its ability to adapt to various scenarios in the business environment.

During development, we discover the need for a plugin for the integrated development environment IntelliJ IDEA that checks the configuration files of the GitLab CI/CD tool. Therefore, we develop an open-source plugin called Gitlab Template Lint, which displays errors and consolidated content of configuration files in the integrated development environment. We publish the developed plugin on the JetBrains plugin marketplace, thus enabling its use by a large number of DevOps developers worldwide.
